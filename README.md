# node_usage
A tool for use on EPCC's Cirrus cluster

Prints summary and detailed info on the state of nodes in the cluster (based on output from the ``pbsnodes`` command).

A node which has some jobs running on it but is not in exclusive mode (i.e. other jobs may make use of the remaining CPUs) is considered to be ``Partfree``.  Nodes on which no CPUs are available (either because they are all being used, or the node is in exclusive mode) and considered to be ``Busy`` as are all of their cores, whether they are actually in use or not.

## Usage:

    code_usage [-a]
    
    -a: Print long-format node usage information, includeing PBS Job IDs running on each node
      
## Example output:

    [ibethune@cirrus-login0 node_usage]$ ./node_usage -a
